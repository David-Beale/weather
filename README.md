When I feel like going on a last minute adventure, I want to find somewhere with good weather.

Most weather apps only let you view one location at a time, and then you have to click on different times of the day to see a full breakdown. 

This app lets you see the weather hour by hour for the whole day (or whole week) for all your locations at a glance, without having to do any clicking.

## Features

* Location search is powered by Google which gives accurate and reliable results.

* The date slider lets you control the date range for all locations with ease. Drag the edges to expand/contract the range.

* Login to automatically save the locations you search for.

* Drag and drop the cards to change the order.

* Drag the charts to move the date range. Use the scroll wheel to zoom in and out.

* Infinite loading and virtualized window for performance.

## Tech stack

* React/redux

* Firestore/Firebase
